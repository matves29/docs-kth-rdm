# Handing over a community for central administration
Once a project concludes and data collection and curation has been finalized, Community owners can hand over the responsibility of preserving the community to the central administration. Before doing so the Community owner needs to provide answers to the following:

### Questions
 - Has data collection and work on the community ceased? 
 - Does any of the data contain files that contain personal data? I.e. does GDPR apply? If so, to which files?
 - Does any of the data contain files that are to be restricted due to confidentiality agreements? If so, which files?
 - Which users will still need access to the data? (NB! external users will be removed from the community, only KTH-accounts can be retained.)
 - If there are files that need to be restricted can the metadata, (e.g. description and title), of these posts be made public?
 - In case users request access to restricted files their requests need to be handled by KTH. Which school and department will provide assitance with request relating to this community?
 - Has the school/department head been informed of the the archiving of the community and data residing in it?
 - Has the school been informed of future costs related to the storage of the data?
 -
